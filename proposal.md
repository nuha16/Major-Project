# Proposal
- I want to make a parody of Tears of Themis. Tears of Themis, is a f2p otome game, quite similar to a dating sim. I find some of the tropes in these types of games quite hilarious, so I want to make a satire version of this game. These types of games are very choice reliant, so there should be routes based on the player's choices. I also intend to make a gacha system like in Tears of Themis, by making some kind of redeemable in-game currency so that players can pull for characters.

## Need to have
- single player
- start page
- dialogue options
- different endings based on player's choices
- background music and sound effects

## Nice to have
- gacha system
- in-game rewards for clearing stages (redeemable at the gacha)
- mini games within the game
- hidden endings
